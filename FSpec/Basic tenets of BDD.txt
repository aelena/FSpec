Instead of subclassing "Test" use a class "Context"
Call methods with "Should" instead of "Test_Whatever"
Instead of using "assert", use methods like "shouldBeEqual ( expected, actual )" and similar
	(see shouldextensions.fs file )
All of these methods must have a trailing message parameter that is optional
